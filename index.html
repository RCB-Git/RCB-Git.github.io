      <p>Hi, Im Robert! I dont know what to put here right now, so im just going to rant about how almonds are awful. Lets look at it this way, when have you ever thougth to yourself, "Im really craving some almonds". Never. If you have, think hard about the choices you mad that caused such an irrational thought.
         what can almonds do that is so good? NOTHING! They are completley overshadowed by other nuts. Almond butter is just the people with peanut allergies being salty, and attempting to replicate peanut butter. Almond milk too. It was just created by the lactose intolerants to have something in their coffie other
          than their cheeseless tears. Thats another thing, if i go into a coffe shop, and they give me more than three options for milk, im leaving. Coffe creamer exists, its fine, use that. your options are whole, Half and Half, and skim. Also, almonds have SKIN. WHAT KIND OF NUT HAS SKIN. 
          Like Popcorn shells, almond skin gets stuck in your teeth. Though unlike popcorn, you cant feel it. You can go hours with almond skin stuck to your teeth without even noticing it, while everyone around you does. Trust me, you dont want people thinking you walk around with bugs in your teeth.   </p>

      <p>Hi, Im Robert! I don’t know what to put here right now, so im just going to rant about how almonds are awful.
        Let’s look at it this way, when have you ever thought to yourself, "Im really craving some almonds". Never. If
        you have, think hard about the choices you mad that caused such an irrational thought.
        what can almonds do that is so good? NOTHING! They are completely overshadowed by other nuts. Almond butter is
        just the people with peanut allergies being salty and attempting to replicate peanut butter. Almond milk too.
        It was just created by the lactose intolerants to have something in their coffee other
        than their cheeseless tears. That’s another thing, if i go into a coffee shop, and they give me more than three
        options for milk, im leaving. Coffee creamer exists, its fine, use that. your options are whole, Half and Half,
        and skim. Also, almonds have SKIN. WHAT KIND OF NUT HAS SKIN?
        Like Popcorn shells, almond skin gets stuck in your teeth. Though unlike popcorn, you can’t feel it. You can go
        hours with almond skin stuck to your teeth without even noticing it, while everyone around you does. Trust me,
        you don’t want people thinking you walk around with bugs in your teeth.
